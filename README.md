# Purpose
While working with pygame I found difficulties with positions and where to place elemnts to be where I want, so I made this tool to make this job easier.

# How to use
Run the exe file (Make sure Assets folder is in the same directory) and input the resolution of your project and the grid size to start the tool.

## Controls
- G: toggle grid
- C: Find center
- Arrow keys: Precise movement (Default is 1 pixel)
- Press X or Y to toogle X and Y axis locks respectively
- Window resizing supported, new resolution is printed in console
- Left Mouse Button: Toggle cursor

# Advanced
- Edit lines 19-26 of main.py to customise the apperance

- WARNING: Changing text size is not recommended as you would have to change lines 100-103 accordingly by testing yourself.
